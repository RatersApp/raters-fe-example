# Project Description: Web3 Authorization Integration in RatersApp
**Raters Frontend Example** integrates Web3 authorization using Next.js and TypeScript.

For the RatersApp project, Web3 authorization was integrated using various libraries and tools. The primary framework for the application is Next.js, and the project is written in TypeScript. Below are the details of the libraries and their purposes in this integration

## Repository Information
This repository is a trimmed example implementation of the frontend part of the RatersApp service, demonstrating the milestone implementations within the ICP developer grant framework.

**Disclaimer:** This is not the complete codebase of RatersApp frontend, but solely for demonstrating Web3 authorization and data recording on the blockchain.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RatersApp/raters-fe-example.git
cd raters-fe-example
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
# or
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
